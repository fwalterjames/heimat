# Heimat real estate SQL
==============================

What is this?
-------------------------------

Postgres dump of raw SQL used to create fictional real estate database.

Multiple tables of multiple columns.

The idea was that there is a fictional app, and that app has a renter/buyer-facing fucntion, a real estate agent-facing fuction, and a property owner facing function.


Why is this?
-------------------------------
The practical usage of the tables has been for me to practice queries and other SQL functions.

It is now here for you to do the same: improving how tables relate, more efficient columns that could be added, redundant columns that can be removed, etc.
